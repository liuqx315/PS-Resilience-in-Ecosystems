# PS-Resilience-in-Ecosystems

This is a repository for the paper "Phase-separation physics underlies new theory for the resilience of patchy ecosystems" by Koen Siteur, Quan-Xing Liu*, Vivi Rotschafer, Tjisse van der Heide, Max Rietkerk, Arjen Doelman, Christoffer Bostrom, and Johan van de Koppel*. 2022 submitted to review.

1. Py_Opencl for spatial 2D phase separation patterns (Equation (3); Fig. 4 in main text)
2. Spinodal region of phase separation occur in Fig. 5A.
3.  Within Figure 3, 'DDA Model_LS.ipynb' and 'SDF Model_LS.ipynbâ€˜ for the data generate on coarsening laws of Figure S12.
4. Figure S12 is codes and data for distictive coarsening behavior presented in Fig. S12.

Abbr
DDA: density-depedent aggregation model; SDF: scale-dependent feedbacks model

Note: please setup the corrected DevinceNr for you computer! "DeviceNr = 2" the number dependent on your graphic card number and setup.
